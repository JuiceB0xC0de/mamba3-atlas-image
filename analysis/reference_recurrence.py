"""B0-7: plain-PyTorch Mamba-3 reference recurrence. CANDIDATE CPU oracle.

NAIVE AND SEQUENTIAL ON PURPOSE. No chunking, no segsum: a token-by-token loop
is the ground truth that a chunked kernel is an optimization OF.

STATUS: candidate, NOT validated. Kernel equivalence is blocked until GPU tensor
parity (gpu_probe g2/g3). Nothing here may be cited as agreeing with the kernel.

DO NOT use upstream/hrsvrn_full/mamba3-minimal/mamba3.py as a reference. It
declares a STATIC `A_log` and computes A = -exp(A_log) (Mamba-2 style). The
official release has no static A and no A_log tensor in its checkpoints.

EVERY RULE BELOW IS TRANSCRIBED FROM PINNED SOURCE. Line references:
  M = upstream/pypi_232_post1/mamba_ssm/modules/mamba3.py
  K = upstream/tilelang/mamba3/mamba3_mimo_fwd.py
  G = upstream/triton/mamba3/angle_dt.py          (byte-identical to the
      pypi_base copy; verified with diff)
  N = upstream/hrsvrn_full/mamba-og/mamba_ssm/ops/triton/layernorm_gated.py

1. SPLIT ORDER                                                     M L177-190
   [z, x, B, C, dd_dt, dd_A, trap, angles]; B/C reshape to (r, g, n).

2. DISCRETISATION                                                  M L194-198
   Delta = softplus(dd_dt + dt_bias)
   A     = -heavy_tail_activation(dd_A), clamped <= -A_floor
   ADT   = A * Delta          (log-retention per step)

3. PHASE  (this is a full re-derivation; the previous version was wrong)  G L94-117
   increment_t = tanh(raw_angle_t) * PI * Delta_t
   phase_t     = ( inclusive_cumsum(increment)_t + carried_state ) mod 2*PI
   The cumsum is INCLUSIVE: position t includes its own increment. The modulo
   uses the floor convention (G L108: x - 2PI*floor(x/2PI)).
   Persistent `angle_dt_state` of shape (batch, nheads, num_rope_angles)
   (M L447) is what makes the phase cumulative ACROSS chunks and steps.

4. ROTARY ON BOTH SIDES -- ESTABLISHED FROM THE PREFILL PATH, NOT INFERRED
   Exact prefill ordering (all line numbers in K):
     L211-215  q loaded, bias added -> q_shared            UNROTATED
     L226      gemm(q_shared, k_shared) -> qk_dot_full     UNROTATED x UNROTATED
     L246-259  q_shared rotated IN PLACE by angles_frag
     L263      gemm(q_shared[ROTATED], states_accum)       interchunk
     L266-275  k_shared rotated IN PLACE, same angle, same sign as q
     L283-287  k scaled by trap_scale
     L290      gemm(q_shared[ROT], k_shared[ROT+trap])     intrachunk
   So PREFILL rotates BOTH sides with the SAME angle and the SAME sign
   (cos*x1 - sin*x2 / sin*x1 + cos*x2, identical form at L258-259 and L274-275).
   Because gemm uses transpose_B, the product is dot(R(t_i)q_i, R(t_j)k_j) =
   q_i^T R(t_j - t_i) k_j, i.e. relative -- but that is a CONSEQUENCE, not the
   reason we rotate both.
   The DIAGONAL is built at L226, BEFORE either rotation, so it uses the
   unrotated product. That is why this file computes the diagonal from Ch/Bh
   rather than Cq/Bq.
   DECODE agrees (M L364-366, apply_rotary_qk_inference_fwd(q=C, k=B)) but the
   file implementing it is absent from the pypi_232_post1 tree; prefill is the
   primary evidence and decode is corroboration only.
   PARTIAL: rotary_dim_divisor = int(2/rope_fraction) (M L99), so only
   Kang = d_state // divisor pairs rotate, pairing index n with n + d_state//2
   (K L246-251, L266-271). With rope_fraction 0.5 that is 32 pairs of 128, i.e.
   indices [0,32) against [64,96); [32,64) and [96,128) pass through untouched.

5. TRAPEZOID, AND THE TWO DISTINCT COEFFICIENTS                    K L182-198
   lambda_t      = sigmoid(trap_t)      (raw logit in; kernel applies sigmoid)
   gamma_t       = Delta_t * lambda_t
   shifted_t     = Delta_{t+1} * (1 - lambda_{t+1}),  0 at the final position
   trap_scale_t  = gamma_t + shifted_t
   These are NOT interchangeable:
     * STRICTLY EARLIER contributions use K scaled by trap_scale   K L283-287
     * the CURRENT-TOKEN DIAGONAL uses gamma ALONE                 K L326
   The kernel masks the diagonal out of the intrachunk product (K L296-298,
   "we do indeed want to exclude the diagonal") and re-adds it separately with
   gamma. Folding the diagonal into the earlier-state update is WRONG.

6. D FEEDTHROUGH IS RANK-EXPANDED                                  K L328-335
   D is added to the DIAGONAL term as  D[h] * PsiV, where PsiV is the
   rank-expanded value  V[r,p] = x[p] * mimo_x[h,r,p]  (K L206-207).
   So D multiplies the per-rank value, NOT the raw x, and it enters BEFORE the
   gate and BEFORE the mimo_o collapse.

7. GATE                                                            K L346-349
   o_gated = z[p] * mimo_z[h,r,p] * 0.5
   gate    = o_gated * tanh(o_gated) + o_gated
   Algebraically that is exactly silu(z * mimo_z): with v = z*mimo_z and
   u = v/2,  u*tanh(u)+u = (v/2)(1+tanh(v/2)) = (v/2)*2*sigmoid(v) = v*sigmoid(v).
   Verified numerically in test_gate_identity, not assumed.

8. COLLAPSE                                                        K L351-365
   y_r *= mimo_o[h,r,p] * gate_r, then SUM over r. Output is (T, H, P).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
TWO DIFFERENT STATE OBJECTS. DO NOT CONFUSE THEM.

The trapezoid makes the naive accumulator FUTURE-AWARE: token i's stored key is
scaled by trap_scale_i = gamma_i + Delta_{i+1}(1 - lambda_{i+1}), which reads
token i+1. So an accumulator measured AFTER injecting token t depends on token
t+1 and is not a causal state. This file therefore exposes both, named apart:

  prefill_accum / prefill_accum_norms      FUTURE-AWARE. Value after injecting
      token t, so index t depends on token t+1. This is a prefill factorization
      artifact. PROHIBITED for state-trajectory claims (C-5) and for anything
      described as "the state at time t".

  online_state_norms                       CAUSAL. The state as READ at step t,
      i.e. after decay and before injecting token t. It contains tokens <= t-1
      whose trapezoidal coefficients are all fully resolved by token t. Index t
      depends only on tokens <= t. This is the object a decode implementation
      would hold, and the only one admissible for state-trajectory claims.

  pending_v[t], pending_k[t]               The deferred half of the two-token
      bookkeeping: token t's value and ROTATED, PRE-trap key, held back because
      trap_scale_t is not yet computable at step t. This mirrors the kernel
      caching k_state and v_state alongside ssm_state (M L238-239, L270-271).

  Contents, for tokens strictly before t:
      online_state[h, p, n] = sum_{i < t} exp( sum_{j in (i, t]} ADT_j )
                                * sum_r V_i[r, p] * Kbar_i[r, n]
  V_i is the rank-expanded value (x * mimo_x); Kbar_i is post-norm, post-bias,
  ROTATED and trap_scale-scaled. The rank axis is CONTRACTED, so the shape is
  (nheads, headdim, d_state) for both arms -- the documented MIMO property that
  state shape is unchanged from SISO.

  NEITHER object is asserted to equal the kernel's `ssm_state`. The kernel
  accumulates chunkwise with DA_CS_REV scaling (K L388-394) and its final-state
  convention is unverified here. Any comparison requires GPU tensor parity.
